In respect to the LLM, it performed fairly well. However, the first few versions
had some limiting factors
    - The initial code did not explicitly check for input shapes or enforce any corner case checks
    - The LLM did not use Cholesky decomposition, which is the standard for computing Gaussian densities

To verify correctness, I compared them with the scipy's implementation to check whether the results I would get were
close to the numbers that SciPy would give me. What I found was that the difference in numbers was so small, 
it was basically negligble amount.

Numbers from testing results can be found in HW2 PDF.


I used SciPy to test out three different parameterizations:
    - Spherical covariance
    - Diagonal covariance
    - Full covariance
