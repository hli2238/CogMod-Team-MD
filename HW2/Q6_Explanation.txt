Graph 1: Posterior vs Prior
	As prior increases, posterior first increases rapidly, and then levels out at the end of the graph. This matches the growth of ln(X)

	
Graph 2: Posterior vs Sensitivity
	As sensitivity increases, posterior increases linearly. 

Graph 3: Posterior vs Specificity
	As specificity increases, posterior increases exponentially.
