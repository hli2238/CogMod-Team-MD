## Importance of Cognitive Modeling to psychology and cognitive science
- Cognitive modeling offers a way for researchers to understand the human mind and how it works. By building models based on their theory, researchers are able to generate predictions about human cognition and later compare those with real world data.
- A practical usage of cognitive modeling is to build human-like AI models. By studying how humans behave, researchers can also design algorithms to mimick those behaviors and cognitive processes. These algorithms can assist AI-systems to interact in more realistic ways which is essential in products such as virtual assistants.
